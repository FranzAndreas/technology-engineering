# System Cluster Configuration Repository

This Git repository serves as a centralized configuration hub for managing Kubernetes clusters using ArgoCD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.


## First access to ArgoCD

ArgoCD has been installed in the argocd namespace of the cluster.
For the first access, you can get the admin password directly from the secret by running this command:

`kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d`

Then, you can initially access the argocd interface by performing a port-forwarding:

`kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443`

After running the command, you should be able to access ArgoCD UI from `localhost:8080`, enter with username **admin** and the admin password.

NOTE: If you have deployed the Helm Chart on a private OKE cluster, you will need to perform some networking setup to be able to connect through kubectl.

## Connecting to the OCI Code Repository

Under `Settings --> Repositories` click on **CONNECT REPO** and select to connect to a repository **VIA HTTPS**.
Fill the form with the following values:
1. `Repository type`: "git"
2. `Repository URL`: <oke-cluster-config clone URL>
3. `Username`: \<OCI username of a user with access to the git repository>
4. `Password`: \<Auth Token of the user>

The repository we want to connect to is the system-cluster-config repository in OCI DevOps, already created by the Resource Manager Stack.
It's better to go into the OCI DevOps, find the repository, and find the right HTTPS clone URL.

NOTE: The username to connect to the OCI DevOps Code Repository should be `<tenancy_name>/<user_domain>/<user_name>`

## Clone the OCI Code Repository locally

It is always better to clone the Git repository locally and have an appropriate IDE where we can work. A lot of YAMLs are involved when managing a cluster,
so it's important to correctly indent the code.
Once you have cloned the **system-cluster-config**, it's time to perform the following actions:
1. Deploy the cluster secret by running `kubectl apply -f in-cluster.yml`
2. Substitute `#RepoURL` in `hub.yml` with the repository https URL from OCI DevOps
3. Substitute `#RepoURL` in `appsets/hub/ci-cd/argocd.yml` and `appsets/hub/infra.yml` with the repository https URL from OCI DevOps
3. Push the code to the remote Git repository
4. Run `kubectl apply -f hub.yml`
5. You will lose the port-forwarding session if still active, but don't worry, it's something expected
6. Access to the ArgoCD UI, and be sure that `hub-apps` application is synchronized

After having performed these steps, you will have an installation of ArgoCD configured with the apps-of-apps pattern.

## Overview

ArgoCD is a tool that automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters by keeping the cluster state in sync with configurations stored in Git repositories. It provides a web UI for visualizing applications, their statuses, and allowing manual or automated syncing.

This repository organizes configurations to install tools and configure clusters through ArgoCD ApplicationSets. ApplicationSets are templates that generate multiple ArgoCD Applications based on defined criteria, allowing scalable deployment across multiple clusters.

## Key Concepts

- **Clusters**: Kubernetes clusters managed by ArgoCD. Each cluster is registered as a Secret in the ArgoCD namespace with labels indicating its type (e.g., "hub" for the main ArgoCD server cluster, "workload" for application clusters), region, provider, and environment.

- **Applications**: Individual deployments managed by ArgoCD, pointing to Helm charts, Kustomize manifests, or plain YAMLs.

- **ApplicationSets**: Templates that generate Applications dynamically. They use generators to define where (clusters) and what (applications) to deploy.

```

### Infrastructure Folder

The `infra/` folder contains cluster-level resources deployed via Kustomize, similar to application structures. It includes base resources and profile-specific overlays.

- **Base Resources**: Common cluster resources like ResourceQuotas, Namespaces, PersistentVolumeClaims, ValidatingAdmissionPolicies, etc.
- **Overlays**: Customizations per profile (e.g., `overlays/hub/` for hub-specific infra).

This ensures foundational cluster configurations are managed consistently across profiles.

### Workflow

1. **Define Clusters**: Create Secrets in ArgoCD for each cluster, labeled appropriately (e.g., `type: hub`).

2. **Bootstrap Hub**: Apply `hub.yml` to deploy ApplicationSets to the hub cluster. This creates ApplicationSets that will generate Applications for matching clusters.

3. **ApplicationSets Generate Applications**: Each ApplicationSet uses generators to:
   - Select clusters based on labels (e.g., `type: hub`).
   - Pull configuration from `apps/*/config/config-*.json` to define what to deploy.

4. **Deploy Applications**: Generated Applications deploy using sources like Helm charts with values, Kustomize overlays, etc., tailored to the cluster type.

## Profiles and Overlays

Cluster profiles are defined by labels on cluster Secrets (e.g., `type: hub`, `type: workload`). These profiles determine which clusters an application deploys to and how it's configured.

- **Profiles**: Hub profile targets clusters with ArgoCD installed. Other profiles (e.g., workload) target application clusters.
- **Kustomize Overlays**: In `apps/category/app/kustomize/overlays/`, provide profile-specific customizations (e.g., `overlays/hub/` for hub clusters).
- **Helm Values**: In `apps/category/app/helm/values/`, YAML files tailored to profiles (e.g., `values-hub.yml`, `values-workload.yml`).

Applications are organized into category folders (e.g., `ci-cd/`, `app-category/`) to maintain order and scalability.

## Summary

1. Set up ArgoCD on your hub cluster.
2. Register clusters as Secrets (apply `in-cluster.yml` for the hub).
3. Customize `hub.yml` with the repo URL and apply it.
4. ApplicationSets will automatically generate and deploy applications to matching clusters.
