# Terraform Stack to be used in OCI Resource Manager to create OCI DevOps pipelines for OCI Functions

Reviewed: 11.2.2025
 
# When to use this asset?
 
Anyone who wants to create OCI DevOps pipelines for OCI Functions using Terraform in OCI Resource manager.
The DevOps project is not specific to any programming language but includes <a href="./files/build_pipeline_specs/">build pipeline specs</a> example files to build and deploy jvm and native Java functions. Source code for a such Function can be found <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/functions/java-helloworld-AI-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions/README.md">here</a>.

# How to use this asset?

Clone this repo locally. In OCI Console click <code>Create Stack</code> under <code>Resource Manager</code> in your project compartment. Drag-n-drop the <a href="./files">files -folder</a> to <code>Stack Configuration</code> (<b>folder type</b>).
<p>
OCI DevOps IAM Policies are not part of the stack, please refer to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/devops_iampolicies.htm">docs</a> how to create them first.
<p>

### Stack settings

Before applying the Stack fill in the vars:

![Stack vars](./files/stack_vars.jpg)

<ul>
    <li><i>initial_image</i> that is used to create the OCI Function as target environment for the OCI DevOps deployment pipeline.
    By default it is loaded from Dockerhub, but you can use any X86 arch image if want to replace this</li>
    <li><i>docker_user</i> is your OCIR Docker user to push the initial image (above) to OCIR repo for the Function. Replace &lt;namespace&gt; with your <code>tenancy namespace</code>. <code>oracleidentitycloudservice</code> is used for federated domains/users, not local</li>
    <li><i>docker_user</i> is our OCIR Docker user password (your user profile auth token in OCI)</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

Run Stacks's Apply to create the OCI DevOps project. 
<p>
The Stack creates only a <i>private subnet</i> in the VCN and hence the Function cannot be called outside the tenancy by default after the build and deploy.
<br>
However, the Function invocation can be done from OCI Cloud Shell either by connecting to the VCN private subnet or to OCI Service Network, both options will work. The invocation can be done as follows using the Stack <code>project_name</code> e.g. :
<pre>
fn invoke helloworldai-java-project helloworldai-java-project
</pre>
