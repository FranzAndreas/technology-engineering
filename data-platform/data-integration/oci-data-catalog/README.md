# OCI Data Catalog
 
Data Catalog is a metadata management service that helps data consumers discover data and improve governance in the Oracle ecosystem.

With OCI Data Catalog, data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, and data stewards have a single self-service environment to discover the data that is available in the cloud sources. Data Catalog helps data providers create a data dictionary comprising technical and business metadata. Data consumers can easily assess the suitability of data for analytics and data science projects.
