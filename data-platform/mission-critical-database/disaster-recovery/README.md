Deals with the technologies supporting disaster recovery, specifically Dataguard, but also covers services such as FSDR (Full Stack Disaster Recovery)

Oracle Data Guard or Active Data Guard is the most effective solution to protect the data of any enterprise and make it available on a 24x7 basis in the face of disasters and other calamities. Data Guard or Active Data Guard is essential for Mission Critical Enterprise Database. Data Guard Cloud functionality includes MAA configuration, Data Guard role transitions, and Monitoring.
A database disaster is an event that causes DATA LOSS or SERIOUS DISRUPTION to applications and services. There can be various causes: power failure, hardware failure, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, earthquakes, vandalism, human error, planned maintenance, or anything else. Most database server disasters cannot be prevented. Disaster Recovery provides SERVICE CONTINUITY in case of geographical disasters or planned outages by recovering or resuming services from a geographically different location. This page will help you get started to understand some basic requirements for Disaster Recovery Opportunities with Data Guard/Active Data Guard.
