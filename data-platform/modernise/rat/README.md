# Real Application Testing (RAT)
 
Oracle Real Application Testing (RAT) option enables you to perform real-world testing of Oracle Database. By capturing production workloads and assessing the impact of system changes on these workloads before production deployment, Oracle Real Application Testing minimizes the risk of instabilities associated with system changes.

SQL Performance Analyzer and Database Replay are key components of Oracle Real Application Testing. Depending on the nature and impact of the system change being tested, and on the type of system the test will be performed, you can use either or both components to perform your testing.

When performing real-world testing, there is the risk of exposing sensitive data to non-production users in a test environment. The test data management features of Oracle Database helps to minimize this risk by enabling you to perform data masking and data subsetting on the test data.
