# Image-to-Text with Oracle OCI Gen AI

This application is built using **Streamlit** and **Oracle OCI Generative AI**, allowing users to upload an image, input a prompt, and receive a text-based response generated by the AI model. It leverages Oracle's Gen AI Inference API for processing multimodal data (text and image).

   - Obtain the following:
     - **Compartment OCID**
     - **Generative AI Service Endpoint**
     - **Model ID** (e.g., `meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct`).
   - Configure your `~/.oci/config` file with your profile details.

2. **Python Environment**
   - Install Python 3.8 or later.
   - Install required dependencies (see below).
