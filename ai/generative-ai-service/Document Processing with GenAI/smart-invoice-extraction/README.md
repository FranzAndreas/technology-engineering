## üöÄ Features

- üîç Automatically identifies key invoice headers using OCI Vision LLM (LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)
- ü§ñ Lets you choose what elements to extract (with type selection)
- üß† Leverages a text-based LLM (Cohere Command R+) for context-aware value extraction
- üß™ Outputs data in clean **JSON** and saves to **CSV**
- üñºÔ∏è Uses image-based prompt injection for high accuracy

## üß† How It Works

1. **User Uploads Invoice PDF**  
   The file is uploaded and converted into an image using `pdf2image` (Ensure you upload one page documents ONLY)

2. **Initial Header Detection (LLaMA-3.2 Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)**  
   The first page is passed to the multimodal LLM which returns a list of fields that are likely to be useful (e.g., "Policy No.", "Amount", "Underwriter").

3. **User Selects Fields and Types**  
   A UI allows the user to pick 3 fields from the detected list, and specify their data types (Text, Number, etc.).

4. **Prompt Generation (Cohere Command A)**  
   The second LLM generates a custom system prompt to extract those fields as JSON.

5. **Full Invoice Extraction (LLaMA-3.2 Vision or Llama 4 Maverick)**  
   Each page image is passed into the multimodal LLM using the custom prompt, returning JSON values for the requested fields.

6. **Data Saving & Display**  
   All data is shown in a `st.dataframe()` and saved to CSV.

## üîß Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. **Install dependencies**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Configuration:**
>
> - Replace all instances of `<YOUR_COMPARTMENT_OCID_HERE>` with your actual **OCI Compartment OCID**
> - Ensure you have access to **OCI Generative AI Services** with correct permissions
> - Update model IDs in the code if needed:  
>   - Vision model: `meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct` or `meta.llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8`
>   - Text model: `cohere.command-a-03-2025`
