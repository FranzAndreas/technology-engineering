## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a file:**
   - Use the sidebar to upload an image (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) or a video (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`).

3. **Set parameters:**
   - For videos, adjust the frame extraction interval and select specific frame ranges for analysis.

4. **Analyze and summarize:**
   - Enter a custom prompt to guide the AI in generating a meaningful summary.
