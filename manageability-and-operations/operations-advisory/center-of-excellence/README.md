# Cloud Center of Excellence

When facing Cloud adoption and digital transformation, one of the key challenges for our customers is setting the right path for adoption to be successful and bring all expected benefits in terms of quicker agility and time to market, reduced TCO, and innovation.

A crucial element is tackling the 'People' pillar, which will include:

A **Cloud Center of Excellence**:  The CCOE is an extended multidisciplinary team that includes both business and technical stakeholders to sponsor and guide the cloud adoption initiative.

**Readiness and Upskilling**: To ensure proper adoption, the teams must be knowledgeable on specific technologies - Develop a comprehensive workforce readiness plan.

A **Change Management Plan**: Create a change management plan to make a company-wide engagement.
